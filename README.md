Telling simple stories from data - Where to start?
Are you a data enthusiast? wondering where to start and how to start telling stories from data?.
Though story telling is a art and demands more creativity, there are some common analysis which can be carried out with any data set.
This article just helps you with those type of common analysis.

>>Look at your dataÂ¶

Its a very crucial part. You need to know and get a feel about the data. In this article we will looking at one day international cricket matches data.
Each row in this data set is about the runs scored by a player in a particular match. Likewise we have data for scores of individual players frm all international players.

>>Steps to Followed:
1.)Identify Dimension & Metrics
2.)Once you have a understanding about what is each row is all about, next we should classify the columns in the data. 
  We can identify what the dimension and metrics in our data. Dimensions are those columns using which we can perform grouping operations. 
  Like countr, state, geography, departments, school names, etch.

3.)Then we should identify the metrics columns. Metrics are basically the numeric columns in our data. Like sales revenue numbers, product volume numbers, ages, marks etc.,

Finally we should derive new metrics and dimensions from the existing column. For example we can derive age buckets from age column. And we can derive month, year, week number etc from date columns.

Dimesions:
Count of unique groups/items
which group/item is appering frequently and its count
Metrics
Mean, Standard Deviation, Min, Max etc.,
Histogram of the metric column
Derive metrics and dimensions
Date column: Year, month, day, day of the week, etc,
Age: Age groups
